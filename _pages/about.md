Welcome to my webpage !
======

I am a PhD student at [Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche Informatique (LaBRI)](https://www.labri.fr/) of [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/). I am working with on Scene Understanding from images under the supervision of [Prof. Vincent Lepetit](https://www.labri.fr/perso/vlepetit/), with a current focus on Scene Geometry Estimation. Our goal is to extract from images several components that relevant for Scene Understanding and exploit relationships between those. 

I received a MRes degree in [Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA)](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/) from [ENS Paris-Saclay](http://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). Before that, I obtained joint MS degrees from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and [Institut d'Optique Graduate School Paristech](https://www.institutoptique.fr/) in Optics, Physics and Signal Processing.
